## 🎮 Overview:

This **Memory Game** is a browser-based card matching game where players flip over pairs of cards to find matching symbols. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (DOM Manipulation), this game emphasizes interactive UI design and client-side logic without the need for any frameworks or external libraries.

- Players flip cards to reveal symbols.
- The goal is to find all matching pairs.
- Only two cards can be flipped at once.
- Cards that do not match are flipped back after a short delay.
- Matching pairs remain face-up.
- A restart button allows players to reset and reshuffle the board.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack:

- **HTML** — For creating the structure of the game layout.
- **CSS** — For styling the game board, cards, transitions, and responsive layout.
- **JavaScript (DOM Manipulation)** — For game logic: shuffling, flipping, matching, and restarting.

## 🧩 Game Mechanics:

- The game initializes with **8 pairs of cards** (16 total), each showing a random letter.
- Cards are **shuffled randomly** on each restart.
- A player can click on two cards:
  - If they match: cards stay face-up.
  - If they don’t match: cards flip back after 1 second.
- The player wins when all 8 pairs are matched.
- The **Restart** button resets the game and shuffles the board.

## 🧪 How to Play:

## 💡 Code Highlights:
